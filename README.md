# Salmon Cookies

## Problem Domain

The goal of this project is to recreate a website for a fictional company called Salmon Cookies using a new framework to the developers. Svelte can be paired with other technologies such as Vite, Material UI and many more.  Svelte was the framework chosen as the technology to redesign the application. The application is a cookie sales website that allows the user to add new stores, and view the sales data for each store. The application also allows the user to add new stores to the website.

## General Comments

Svelte offers an easy front end experience. It is a great framework for developers who want to build small applications quickly; great for prototyping! This is because Svelte has a unique solution that brings JavaScript, CSS, and HTML to one document. Once working with Svelte, there is close connection to working with regular old HTML, but in the new and innovative way. That unification can also be a recipe for confusion when building large applications.

### Cons
